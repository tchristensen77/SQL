## This file contains SQL queries for week 2 of Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL challenge

## In this challenge, Danny is trying to launch his pizza business. 
## He has been collecting data but it isn't clean and some of the data types are incorrect. 

## First I will need to clean the data before being able to answer his questions.

UPDATE
	pizza_runner.customer_orders
SET 
  exclusions = 'none'
WHERE 
  exclusions = ' '
