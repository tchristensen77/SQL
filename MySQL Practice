## I started learning SQL using PostgreSQL, in this file I am praticing using MySQL

## Creating Tables

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20)
);

## Created a student table with 3 columns:
## 1. student_id which is the primary key with an integer data type
## 2. name for the students name in a string data type with up to 20 characters
## 3. major for the students major in a string data type with up to 20 characters

DESCRIBE student;

## Used DESCRIBE to make sure the table was created correctly
## Adding a new column for a students gpa in a decimal data type with 3 digits, 2 digits after in the decimal

ALTER TABLE student 
ADD gpa DECIMAL(3, 2);

ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;

## Removed the gpa column.

## Adding Information to Tables

## Adding information to the student table then making sure it was entered correctly.

INSERT INTO student
VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');

SELECT *
FROM student;

INSERT INTO student
VALUES(2, 'Kate', 'Sociology'),
(3, 'Claire', 'Sociology'),
(4, 'Jack', 'Biology'),
(5, 'Mike', 'Computer Science');
