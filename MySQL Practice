## I started learning SQL using PostgreSQL, in this file I am praticing using MySQL

## In this scenario, we are working for a University to help update their data warehouse and provide information about the students.
## Creating student table with information about the student's ID, their name and their major. ID is integer datatype, name and major are string data types.

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20)
);

DESCRIBE student;

## Used DESCRIBE to make sure the table was created correctly
## Adding a new column for a student GPA in a decimal data type with 3 digits, 2 digits after in the decimal

ALTER TABLE student 
ADD gpa DECIMAL(3, 2);

ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;

## Removed the gpa column because administration changed their mind about including GPA in this table.

## Adding studnet information to the student table

INSERT INTO student
VALUES (1, 'Jack', 'Biology'),
    (2, 'Kate', 'Sociology'),
    (3, 'Claire', 'Sociology'),
    (4, 'Jack', 'Biology'),
    (5, 'Mike', 'Computer Science');

SELECT *
FROM student

## Jack (student ID: 4) wants to go by his full name: Jackson

UPDATE studend
SET name = 'Jackson'
WHERE student_id = 4

##  A new student enrolled in University

INSERT INTO student
VALUES (6, 'Hannah', 'Nursing')
